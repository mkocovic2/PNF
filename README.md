# PNF
PNF(Player Not Found) is a small multiplayer game made in Unity. Utilizing the Photon Network, users can join or create lobbies for others to join. 

## Building PNF
PNF is a Unity game that I built over the summer. It's a project I wanted to build from the ground up, leaving me to create assets, audio, and maps from scratch. This project involved a lot of on-the-spot learning. This involved learning the Unity engine while also grasping the programming behind the Photon Network.

## Applications
1. Blender: Used for creating game models, weapons, and other small assets for UI.
2. GAEA: Terrain generation for maps and other small assets.
3. Unity: Used to host scripts and run the game.
4. Visual Studio: IDE for making C# scripts for the game. 

## How to open
1. Open Unity
2. Select the "Open File" Button and find the file where the game is located.
3. Once the file is opened, click on the run button.
4. To build the game, select file->build or press ctrl + B.

## Game Features
- Multiplayer
- Lobbies
- Real-time Connection

## Gameplay Summary
PNF is a simple first-person shooter with some minor complexities. Each player is equipped with a laser rifle and a grappling hook, adding an exciting dimension to the gameplay. The map encapsulates the gameplay, allowing players to change momentum and direction at any point. 

## Bugs and Issues
The game itself is my first time tackling the C# language. While I do have experience in C++, the way the engine handles scripts and commands is something that I've had to get used to. Due to time constraints, some features cause annoying issues. However, there are workarounds. These issues will be fixed as quickly as possible!

1. Timer doesn't sync across network(all players must put the same time)
2. Mouse Sensitivity applies to all players(Best to leave at 200)
3. Mouse Sensitivity by default is 0(Press apply in settings to change this)

## Currently in Development
1. Audio: Audio is currently being made in Audacity from scratch. 
2. Custom Names: Easy addition, will be added soon. Names are currently "Player" + random number.
3. Leaderboard: View gameplay statistics, points and deaths.
4. Maps: Currently, there is one map. More will be developed soon!
