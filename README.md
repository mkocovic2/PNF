## Gameplay Summary
PNF is a simple first-person shooter with some minor complexities. Each player is equipped with a laser rifle and a grappling hook, adding an exciting dimension to the gameplay. The map encapsulates the gameplay, giving players the oppurtunity change momentum and direction at any point. 

## Bugs and Issues
The game itself is my first time tackling the C# language. While I do have experience in C++, the way the engine handles scripts and commands is something that I've had to get used to. Due to time constraints there are some features that cause annoying issues, however, there are work-arounds. These issues will be fixed as quickly as possible!

1. Timer doesn't sync across network(all players must put the same time)
2. Mouse Sensitivity applies to all players(Best to leave at 200)
3. Mouse Sensitvity by default is 0(Press apply in settings to change this)
